# Subway_People_Counter

This Web Application is for Javascript learning purposeses.
I created this Application with the help of Javascript, HTML and CSS. 
This Application counts the amount of people entering a Subway a time and saving the data within the website to check how many people entered the subway at a particular point of time.
